<p>
  This is the most minimal example of Dropzone. The upload in this example
  doesn't work, because there is no actual server to handle the file upload.

<!-- Change /upload-target to your upload address -->
<form action="../assets" class="dropzone">
	
	<div class="fallback">
    <input name="file" type="file" multiple />
  </div
</form>
